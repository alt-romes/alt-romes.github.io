# You Already Understand Types

This post is targeted at programmers unfamiliar with functional programming and
type systems, but curious about how functional programmers wield their types
and make sense out of them.

It might come off as surprising, but *you already understand types*!

* Programmers are familiar with logic: a ^ b, a v b, a => b, (a ^ b) => c, a => (b => c)
* Type systems are one of those things that you already know if you know logic,
    but you might've never seen the connection thus never understood one side of
    the equation.
    - Just like that company rebranding the same game under a different skin,
        logic and programming are two sides of the same coin, there's a
        mathematical one-to-one correspondence between types and logical
        propositions (and even between computer programs and mathematical proofs)
